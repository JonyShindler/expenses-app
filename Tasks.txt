HomePage:

ExpenseDetails page needs links back to query and also back to all expenses?

We need to be able to have dropdowns with NONE or blank for category and month so we can query more easily
Also lets have the query options on the RHS and the expenses smaller as the columns are very big.

We probs dont need an 'allExpenses' sheet as queries will be the same thing? Same as we have in excel.
